     - Default to the current directory in the checkout method

0.43 Wed 25 Nov 2009 19:46:38 GMT 2009
     - Switch to Module::Install so we can have repository metadata in
       META.yml
     - No other changes from the previous 0.42_01 dev release.

0.42_01 Mon Nov 23 12:12:51 GMT 2009
     - allow put_object to update other heads than just 'master'
       (thanks to martijn)
     - Fix bug when the ref dirs are more than two levels deep
     - Fix commit object to support multiple parents.  This is seen in merge
       commits
     - Add object_kind method to tag objects.
     - Change to MANIFEST.SKIP based dist building.
     - Dev release with version bump skipping 0.42 so that Gitalist can depend
       on >= 0.42 but we don't have to push a real release until I've done
       a little more maintainance work.

0.41 Tue Apr 21 20:41:07 BST 2009
     - allow subdirectories in .git/refs/*/ (thanks to martijn)
     - run protocol.t test with --base-path to not care about where
       on the filesystem the checkout is (thanks to martijn)
     - when parsing a commit, split up the author and committer
       fields into name, email and commit time. This adds two new
       DateTime fields, authored_time and committed_time to ::Commit
       and changes the type of the author and committer fields to
       Git::PurePerl::Actor, which is an object with name and
       email fields (thanks to martijn)
     - add the parent field to a new commit when available (thanks
       to martijn)
     - allow bare repositories with the gitdir parameter (thanks
       to martijn)
     - fill new commits with real author, authored_time, committer,
       committed_time and comment (thanks to martijn)
